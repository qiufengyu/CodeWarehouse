1#$#(Graphical Edition Released, BreezyCalc: http://breezycalc.sourceforge.net/)Lincalc is a console calculator  designed to provide a quick and simple interface to a very powerful engine. Its parser is based on muParser <http://muparser.sourceforge.net/>. It supports user-defined variables, logical operators for conditions, and a wide range of mathematical functions each calculation that is made is stored in a result variable (Ans1, Ans2..) and can be referenced in equations. It also supports evaluation of multiple equations each separated by a  , .Conditional Statements:-- Ex. (condition) ? (true val) : (false val)Logic Operators:-- && (and), || (or)Comparison Operators:-- <= (less than or equal to)-- >= (greater than or equal to)-- <  (less than), > (greater than)-- != (not equal to), == (equal to)Functions: abs, exp, sqrt, avg, sum, min, max, sign, rint, ln, log10, log2, sin, sinh, asin, asinh, cos, cosh, acos, acosh, tan, tanh, acos, acosh#$#?

You can always run  uping /?  to get all the possible parameters.#$#?
17#$#A truck stop locator.Using the globe/display capabilities of Marble and publicly available data, you can see where weigh stations, truck stops, and rest areas are around the country in an easy to use, intuitive manner.TSL is a demo; I will be using something like it for personal use, but in order to get it working properly I offer this for all to use, free of charge.TSL is not designed to highlight every single possible diesel refueling location in the USA.  TSL is specifically designed with the over the road trucker in mind, with the hopes that it will make life easier to plan repeated trips across the 48.Better trip planning will help you save both time and money.I have listed TSL as stable/production ready.  It relies heavily upon Marble as well as OpenStreetMap.org, two very mature code bases at this point.  You should be able to use this without any problems.  The only thing are missing data entries.(locations)  I am working to add them as time permits.#$#?
