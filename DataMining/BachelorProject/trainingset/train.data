What Acrylic does is to reduce the time dedicated to name resolution for frequently visited addresses as close to zero as possible.With Acrylic you can also gracefully overcome short downtimes of your DNS servers without disrupting your work, because in this case you will at least be able to connect to your favourite sites and to your email server. In addition Acrylic can help you to effectively block unwanted ads prior to their download through the use of a custom HOSTS files, optimizing your navigation experience even further.#$#Communications,Name Service (DNS),Networking,

It requires a small learning curve.It also provides an implicit representation of simplices, not directly encoded in a data structure, which we call ghost simplices.#$#Algorithms,Libraries,Object Oriented,

629#$#This tool will allow for videoconference sessions with up to 6 people, using audio or video. The main idea is to make it easy for students to set up a session without the intervention of the teacher and to record and archive the recording without the need of installing additional software. There are two interfaces: the recorder and the player. The recorder should distinguish itself from already existent videoconferencing systems by its ease of use, recording and archiving which should be its main features. The player s most distinctive functionality is the solo/mute buttons which allow teachers to listen to the group or to a specific learner in isolation. There will be no moderator or administrator roles, all participants will have the same profile and it will be designed specifically for language students carrying out synchronous tasks.#$#Chat,Languages,Web Conferencing,

Given that the controller can accept data from over the network, another embedded controller that is able to use these kinds of cameras can be loaded with this software to send the image and depth data from the 3D camera over the network to the other controller.Currently, KinectStreamer can only use the libfreenect library as its driver.

The image manager is a central part of IQM��s architecture and allows a rapid comparison between different image processing settings. Parallel processing of image sequences is supported, too. It is possible to load and process large image stacks in a virtual mode without loading the images into memory.#$#Medical Physics,Scientific/Engineering,Simulations,

1951#$#The Wittgen programming language consists of just two instructions and one special variable name.Wittgen allows you to assign any text string to a variable of any name. It also allows you to retrieve the text assigned to that variable. Lastly, it has a special variable called ��Doing Now��. Every execution step consists of retrieving the contents of Doing Now, removing the first assign found in that content and performing that assign. In the course of performing that assign any retrieve operations indicated in the text are performed before committing the assign. That is all there the system does.The driving motivation for this design is that as far as we know, the human mind supports these two instructions.It may have additional mechanisms that create new assigns, but using the results of these mechanisms requires a system built from these instructions.#$#Algorithms,Compilers,Psychology,

These modifications use phpbb user tables, sessions, everything. What it does is to set cookies for each domain through using iframes, which load some connect.php file that is placed on the other remote domains which needs authentication from phpbb. This is how numerous sites like facebook do it. Currently there is no other way of legally setting cookies for different domains than the one that is active. You have to have a page that loads up all the cookie setting codes from remote domains.However the loading up of authentication page, the remote authenticator pages in their iframes, and the redirection is VERY fast, taking only 1 seconds or 1.5 seconds. just like how you see in facebook etc - or any other site that uses this method.All files contain extensive comments, and also include configuration variables to change.#$#Internet,Message Boards,Site Management,

Multispectral imaging has been gaining popularity and has been gradually applied to many fields besides remote sensing. However, due to the high dimensionality of the data, both human observers and computers have difficulty interpreting this wealth of information. Gerbil facilitates the visualization of the relationship between spectral and topological information in a novel fashion. It puts emphasis on the spectral gradient, which is shown to provide enhanced information for many reflectance analysis tasks. It also includes a rich toolbox for evaluation of image segmentation and other algorithms in the multispectral domain. The parallel coordinates visualization technique is combined with hashing for a highly interactive visual connection between spectral distribution, spectral gradient, and topology.#$#Astronomy,Viewers,Visualization,

Capsule-oriented programming is designed to address the challenges of concurrent programming. A central goal of this programming style is to provide tools to enable programmers to simply do what they do best, that is, to describe a system in terms of its modular structure and write sequential code to implement the operations of those modules. Capsule-oriented programs are implicitly concurrent. There are no explicit threads or synchronization locks; if necessary or beneficial, concurrency is introduced by the compiler. Capsule-oriented programming eliminates two classes of concurrency errors: sequential inconsistency and race conditions due to shared data.

In advanced mode the program can fix the zip structure of these new  Office Open  format files, a step which I now recommend despite our dissuasive blurb which comes up when you start that function.

NAND is Turing Complete because all digital technology can be described as combinations of NANDs. A node that represents the statement that 2 nodes are perpendicular is a NAND because other nodes can be parallel to one, the other, but not both. This is a new branch of math that most naturally represents the Max Clique view of the P vs NP math problem (and its million dollar millenium prize for proving P equals or does not equal NP) this way: Node pairs without edges have a dot products of 0, and with edges its 1. A dot product of -1 means parallel and opposite directions. By using spring-like forces (in specific softwares using FuzzyNAND) the Max Clique math problem can be represented in a possibly hill climbable way. This is a minimalist language where statements can refer to eachother in terms of dot product.

We use it to index around a terabyte of new log data per day. You can use it too. Who doesn t have `just too many  log files?Occursions asynchronously tails log files and indexes the individual lines in each log file as each line is written to disk so you don t even have to wait for a second after an event happens to search for it.Occursions uses custom disk backed data structures to create and search its indexes so it is very efficient at using CPU, memory and disk.You can extend Occursions with shared libraries to support your own file formats, even binary file formats!#$#Database Engines/Servers,JSON,Web Services,

Currently, when training corpus, compared with CRF++, CRF# can make full use of multi-core CPUs and only uses very low memory, and memory grow is very smoothly and slowly while amount of training corpus, tags increase. with multi-threads process, CRF# is more suitable for large data and tags training than CRF++ now.

The general idea is to try and get the things that computers are good at correct: character conversion, graphic conversion, etc.  Page layout suffers because control in RTF is pretty pathetic compared to TeX.  Consequently, it is likely that manual reformatting will be needed.Translation of bibliographies is pretty good and a wide range of styles are handled, but you must typeset your LaTeX file to create the needed .aux and .bbl files first.Translation of equations used to be excellent: it used to be possible to double-click equations in Word and then edit with MathType.  Unfortunately, this conversion in Word has gotten progressively worse over the years (I changed nothing!).  Unfortunately, the only solution is to converting to MTEF objects, which is a major rewrite (but would make OpenOffice users much happier.)

It is self-hosted, i.e. its Java code runs on itself without requiring a second virtual machine. Most other virtual machines for the Java platform are written in native code (typically C or C++). A Java implementation provides ease of portability and a seamless integration of virtual machine and application resources such as objects, threads, and operating-system interfaces.#$#Compilers,Design,Object Oriented,Virtual Machines,

For a complete analysis and estimate of time to extirpation one would execute a large number of individual simulations evenly distributed over parameter space to estimate the time at which an arbitrary percentage of the simulations show extirpation.#$#Ecosystem Sciences,Scientific/Engineering,Simulations,
